# rubenhdz1213.github.io | Mineral Madness
so basically this is a funny game about mining and automating  
use mine to mine resources  
use move and type in a direction (up, down, left, right) to move around the infinite map  
use location to see where you are  
use recipes to see what you can craft  
use craft to craft things  
you can craft the tools in the recipes to speed up mining  
no this isnt a copy of that one first person game from 2022 called mineral madness
