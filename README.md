# rubenhdz1213.github.io | Mineral Madness

so basically this is a funny game about mining and automating  
use mine \<amount> to mine resources  
use move \<direction> (cardinal directions) to move around the infinite map  
use location to see where you are  
check recipes at <https://github.com/rubenhdz1213/rubenhdz1213.github.io/wiki/> to see what you can craft  
use craft to craft things  
you can craft the tools in the recipes to speed up mining  
no this isnt a copy of that one first person game from 2022 called mineral madness
